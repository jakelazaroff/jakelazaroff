# Hi, I'm Jake! 👋

I'm just a programmer trying to make a home for myself on the WWW.

Some things I've written:

- [An Interactive Intro to CRDTs](https://jakelazaroff.com/words/an-interactive-intro-to-crdts/)
- [The Website vs. Web App Dichotomy Doesn't Exist](https://jakelazaroff.com/words/were-react-hooks-a-mistake/)
- [Web Components Will Outlive Your JavaScript Framework](https://jakelazaroff.com/words/web-components-will-outlive-your-javascript-framework/)

Some things I've built:

- 🏛️ [**jake.museum**](https://jake.museum) — a gallery of every website I've ever made
- 🎥 [**SongRender**](https://songrender.com) — a generative music video creator
